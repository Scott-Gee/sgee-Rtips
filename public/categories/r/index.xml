      <description>For week 2 there are lots of calculations to be done which can be done with dplyr and the mutate, group_by and summarise functions.
The challenge can be found here
First load libraries and read in data
library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(writexl) dat &amp;lt;- read_excel(&amp;#39;week2-data.xlsx&amp;#39;) Next, clean up the model field to leave only the letters. This is done with the regex [aA-zZ]
dat_q1 &amp;lt;- mutate(dat, Brand = str_extract(Model, &amp;quot;[aA-zZ]+&amp;quot;)) Work out order value by calculating quantity x value per bike</description>

      <description>Week 3 is mostly calculations that can be done with dplyr.
The challenge can be found here
First load libraries and read in data. We can use map_df from the purrr package to read in multiple sheets from the same excel file. To use you will need a list, in which the objects you want to be evaluated in a function one-by-one.
Below we create a list of the names of the sheets in the excel file and then use the read_excel function with each sheet defined as .</description>

      <description>Week 4 is similar at the start to week 3 but requires the use of joins for the first time in these challenges. This can be done with the inner_join function in dplyr. If you know SQL, the syntax will be simple to pick up.

First load libraries and read in data. We are using map_df again to read in multiple sheets.</description>

      <description>Week 5 was definitely more challenging than recent weeks and dealing with duplication can be quite hard in R. It can be helpful to group by the columns of interest and then filter using filter(date = max(date) to get the latest record or filter(date = min(date) for the first record for specific columns.

      <description>For week 6 it showed how little code can be used to manipulate and summarise data in R using dplyr. pivot_longer and pivot_wider were also used to restructure data in to the required format.
First load libraries and read in data. Removing the dollar sign with str_remove_all. The ^ will remove everything but digits (0-9).
library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(data.table) dat &amp;lt;- read_excel(&amp;#39;week6-data.xlsx&amp;#39;) #remove dollar sign dat &amp;lt;- dat %&amp;gt;% mutate(MONEY = str_remove_all(MONEY, &amp;quot;[^0-9]&amp;quot;), MONEY = as.</description>

      <description>This short post will show how to change the colour of different words in a ggplot2 title. It can be useful to remove the legend and show the colour in the titles to remove some chart junk.
Using the gapminder dataset and filtering for Argentina and Australia, I use some simple code to create a plot for the change in life expectancy over time.
